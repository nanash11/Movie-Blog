# X-Men First Class - Review

## TLDR

Highlights
- Michael Fassbender as Magneto
- James McAvoy as Charles Xavier
- Jennifer Lawrence as Mystique
- Action Scenes
- Act 3 is pretty cool

Mixed Reaction To
- The younger mutants
    - I like Beast and Angel, but the others are not written that well
- The writing is passable, but nothing too impressive
- Villains have cool powers but are somewhat forgetable
- Sebastian Shaw feels powerful, but a bit underwhelming
    - His motivation seems stupid
- CGI


Lowlights
- Cold War stuff is fairly uninteresting and feels like a cheap way to raise the stakes
- Pacing is not the best, Act 1 is particularly slow
